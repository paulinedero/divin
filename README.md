# DIVIN

## GOAL
The goal of this project was to provide an application for farmers to manage stocks, connect with other farmers and monitor orders and sales.
This was the last project, realized during the Wild Code School bootcamp of 5 months.

## REQUIREMENTS

### Git
If you're not using Git, please download the latest version on:
[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
Choose the right version, corresponding to your OS.

### Node.js and NPM
If you're not using Node.js,  please download the latest version on:
[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Choose the right version, corresponding to your OS.

### Expo CLI
If Expo is not installed yet, open a Terminal window and execute the following command: 
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```
Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. Expo CLI also has a web-based GUI that pops up in your web browser when you start your project ‚Äî you can use the GUI instead of the command line interface if you're not yet comfortable using a terminal or prefer GUIs, both have similar capabilities.

Verify that the installation was successful by running `expo whoami`. You're not logged in yet, so you will see "Not logged in". You can create an account by running expo register if you like, or if you have one already run expo login, but you also don't need an account to get started.

### Expo Go App
The fastest way to get up and running is to use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. Expo Go allows you to open up apps that are being served through Expo CLI.
Please download the Expo Go App on your phone to render the App: 

ü§ñ Android Play Store - Android Lollipop (5) and greater.

üçé iOS App Store - iOS 11 and greater.

### IDE
You need an IDE on your computer to open the code and execute the commands.
Open the project on your IDE or if you want to install another one, prefer VSCode.

### Mysql
Our project runs with a Mysql database. Please install the MySql2 module : 
```
npm install mysql2
```

## PROJECT'S INITIALIZATION

### Download project from GITHUB
Open a Terminal Window and navigate to the right folder using the `cd` command.
Download the complete GitHub Repo from Main Branch: 
[https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/brussels-2021-mars-project3-divin.git](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/brussels-2021-mars-project3-divin.git)

### Open project in VSCode
Open your IDE and choose "File" > "Open the folder".
Select the downloaded folder. 
You'll see on the Navigation Panel the differents files and folders.

### Execute sql-scripts
You'll first need to create the database with Mysql. 
Connect to Mysql using your Terminal and run the scripts: Init.sql, Alter.sql and Insert.sql.
Your database is created. 

### Modify .env files in server-folder and divin-folder
There are 2 .env.sample files. These are models to use. First, rename those 2 files. Replace the sample credentials with yours and the database's data's. Don't forget to check your IP address to add it in the .env files.

### Install dependencies and run server/app

Navigate to the server-folder with the `cd server` command. Execute:
```
npm install
``` 
and then 
```
npm start
```

Navigate to the divin-folder with the `cd..` and `cd divin` commands. Execute:
```
npm install
``` 
and then 
```
npm start
```

When you run `expo start` (or `npm start`), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

## RUN PROJECT LOCALLY
You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously. Go ahead and try it on an iPhone and Android phone at the same time if you have both handy.

üçé On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.

ü§ñ On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
